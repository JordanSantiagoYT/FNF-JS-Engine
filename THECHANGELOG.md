V1.49.0-prerelease;

Additions:

TOO MANY TO LIST LMAO

There's too many changes to list them here lol, you'll just have to figure those out yourself

One of them being the updater has been changed to be hardcoded instead of making an temp bat file (LMMK IF THIS CAUSES ISSUES)

Removals:

Removed a *LOT* of options that were useless, and could be coded in Lua anyways (Lua options coming soon still!)
Removed Icon JSONS due to them being an piece of crap and just causing more confusion/bugs then it helped

Fixes/Changes:

Fixed the *UPDATER* being BROKEN finally OMG

Git Commits are no longer in the version number which should fix the updater being "out of date" and it should no longer attempt to update to newer (unreleased) versions hopefully, mainly for testing reasons.

I AM SO SORRY FOR PUSHING AN BROKEN UPDATE AND NOT FIXING IT UNTIL MONTHS LATER LOL (I was on vacation)

MacOS now has builds for both ARM and Intel, so you can now play on both an ARM CPU and an X86 CPU (Intel), so no need to use Rosetta. (Updater isn't supported for anything but Windows, and will probably remain that way for an while).

Mobile port is *DISCONTINUED CURRENTLY* since I'm busy with a lot of things and I don't have the time/resources to continue the mobile port. So for now, the mobile port will not receive any fixes/patches and will remain out of date until then.
