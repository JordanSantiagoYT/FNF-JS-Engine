1.49.1;

NOTE THAT I (MOXIE) WAS THE ONE WHO RELEASED THIS, NOT JORDAN LOL, I ONLY EDITED HIS DRAFT

note from jordan santiago: 1.50.0 is delayed until i hit 100k :trollface:

Removals:

Benchmark state and Away3D because they were ultimately useless here in this instance
Win/lose bar colors & "OG HP Colors" options since those can be recreated in Lua

Changes:
Dave & Bambi/Strident Crisis icon bops are now frame independent
Dave Engine health bar was updated to the design used in Volume 1

Bug-fixes (I got lazy writing this):
Fixed some crashes regarding Notes(?)
Fixed issues with the "Chart Editor playtesting" due to the changes in 1.49.0-Prerelease
(Hopefully) Fix the original double note ghost script not working anymore
