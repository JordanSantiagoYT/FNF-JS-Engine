1.49.0;

Changes from the Pre-release version:

Removals:

YT Watermark option, and Ratings counter (can both be recreated in Lua)

Bug-fixes:

Fixed an issue when attempting to loading an backup JSON in the chart editor (by not re-saving it, an oversight on my end whoops)
Fix Rendering mode paths on Mac And Linux(?)
Fix an crash in Weekend 1 from Nenes knife (that little devil)
Fixed runHaxeCode not working, along with possibly many other functions (it was literally an ONE LINE FIX)
Fixed "ShaderHandler" not working, because the required functions were private. (But requires to use 0.7 code currently)
